This is a        paragraph.

This in another one, which is deliberately quite long just to see if it prints well according to word-wrap options, or just      in regards to what value is set to $TERM_WIDTH, which is normally set to the terminal width, or to 80 if it is greater than 80. Well I could stop here I think.

Using two asterisks **this text is bold**. Two underscores __work as well__.

Let's make it *italic now*. You guessed it, _one underscore is also enough_.

Can we combine **_both of that_?** Absolutely.    The same, with ***three stars***

What if I want to ~~strikethrough~~?

Let's print an `inline code` in this one. And with ``backticks `in it` ?``
